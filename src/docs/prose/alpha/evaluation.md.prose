# Evaluation model

Prose provides tools in the `fr.jeremyschoffen.prose.alpha.eval` namespace to
evaluate Clojure code. There are several things to take into account, just
using `eval` on 'code as data' isn't sufficient.


## Considerations
At the moment, the main use case of prose is the creation of programmable
documents by embedding Clojure inside them. In other words we want documents as
Clojure programs.

The basic idea we cover here works in three phases:
- turn prose text into 'Clojure code as data' using our reader
- use Clojure's evaluation mechanism to evaluate this 'code as data'.
  The result of this evaluation is treated as data representing the final
  document (we tend to use enlive style trees).
- compile the tree to a compilation target, HTML for instance.

The eval part of this algorithm presents challenges that we explore here.

### Naive evaluation and `require`
Directly using the `eval` function on the data returned by our reader has
issues.

For instance the document:
◊t/clojure-sample {readme/example-doc.html.prose}

is read as:
◊t/clj{
  ◊(-> "prose/alpha/readme/example-doc.html.prose"
     lib/slurp-doc
     lib/read-doc
     pp/pprint
     with-out-str)
}

Using eval on this vector is problematic:
◊t/code {
  (try
    (-> "prose/alpha/readme/example-doc.html.prose"
     lib/slurp-doc
     lib/read-doc
     eval)
    (catch Exception e
      (-> e .getCause .getMessage)))
}

This is a classic problem, requiring a namespace and using it in the same
evaluation is a no go in Clojure. To solve this, we can evaluate each element
in sequence and return the sequence of evaluations. It doesn't solve all
possible cases but it seems sufficient for most uses.


### Evaluation and namespaces interactions
Since we use eval, a lot of things can happen.

When it comes to Clojure namespaces in particular:
- Every var definition in made in the document will be added to the namespace
  from which the document is evaluated. One problem that can arise is that we
  can accidentally redefine vars that way.
- When evaluating several documents, all definitions made in documents could
  stack up in the same namespace and again interfere with each other.
- If for some reason the document uses code that changes the current namespace,
  it changes the current namespace for the code evaluating it.

To mitigate these types of issues our tools allow for the evaluation of
documents in ephemeral namespaces. The idea here is to create an new namespace
with a random name for each document evaluation. We can then switch to it, evaluate
the document, switch back and delete it. Unless code inside the document uses
something like `in-ns` or the `ns` macro, no definition made inside the document
should pollute the original namespace.

The use of Sci can is also a solution to these kind of problems since it allows
the creation of isolated evaluation environments.

### Multi-threading
We may want to evaluate several documents in parallel. However it seems like the
Clojure namespace machinery isn't meant to be used from several threads.

See:
◊t/code {
  (try
    (deref (future (lib/eval-doc '[(+ 1 1)(+ 1 2)])))
    (catch Exception e
      (-> e ex-cause ex-cause ex-cause ex-message)))
}

Since we want to use ephemeral namespaces this is a problem for a pure Clojure
evaluation scheme. Sci is an interesting solution to get around this limitation.


## The current evaluation toolkit.
At this time evaluating documents is similar to evaluating a script. A document
is read as a sequences Clojure forms. We then want to evaluate these forms in
order. To implement this scheme and provide solutions to the above
considerations prose provides an evaluation model inspired by the ring spec
in the ◊t/sym[eval-common] namespace.

### Basics
As the ring model uses a map to represent a web request, we use a map to represent
an evaluation. Such maps are constructed with the
◊t/sym[eval-common/make-evaluation-ctxt] function.
◊(t/source eval-common/make-evaluation-ctxt)

The evaluation proper is realized by the ◊t/sym[eval-common/evaluate-ctxt]:
◊(t/source eval-common/evaluate-ctxt)

Note that forms are evaluated in sequence using ◊t/sym[eval-common/eval-forms*]:
◊(t/source eval-common/eval-forms*)

This prevent the usual cases of problems that could happen with using `require`
inside of documents.

The ◊t/sym[eval-common/evaluate] function is provided as a helper to tie this model together:
◊(t/source eval-common/evaluate)


The rest of the ◊t/sym[eval-common] namespace provides
tools that answer our other considerations in the form of middleware for the
◊t/sym[eval-common/evaluate-ctxt] context function.


### Error management
We have already seen that ◊t/sym[eval-common/evaluate-ctxt] returns the
evaluation context with either an added `:result` or `:error` keys. The
middleware ◊t/sym[eval-common/wrap-eval-result] may be used to transform
◊t/sym[eval-common/evaluate-ctxt] into a function that either returns the result
of an evaluation or throws an exception.
◊(t/source eval-common/wrap-eval-result)


### Ephemeral namespaces
The ephemeral namespace behavior is provided by the use of two different
middleware:
- ◊t/sym[eval-common/wrap-snapshot-ns] makes sure that the current namespace
  after the evaluation is the same as before:
◊(t/source eval-common/wrap-snapshot-ns)

- ◊t/sym[eval-common/wrap-eval-in-temp-ns] creates an ephemeral namespace, makes
  it the current one, evaluates code then deletes it:
◊(t/source eval-common/wrap-eval-in-temp-ns)

### Generality of the model
This whole execution model takes an `eval-form` function as a parameter.
For instance here is ◊t/sym[eval-common/eval-forms-in-temp-ns]:
◊(t/source eval-common/eval-forms-in-temp-ns)

Using anything other than the default `eval` provided by Clojure is possible.
Although not implemented here, we could use this in self-hosted ClojureScript
and that's what we do with sci. Take a look at the
◊t/sym[eval-sci/eval-forms-in-temp-ns] function:
◊(t/source eval-sci/eval-forms-in-temp-ns)

We can see that this function uses the machinery provided by the common
namespace (the last line of code). The `eval-form` function used named `ef` is
created with:
◊(t/source eval-sci/sci-ctxt->sci-eval)


### Multi-threading, Sandboxing... Sci
Sci is interesting in this project for different reasons. For instance, where
the Clojure version failed, with Sci we can do:
◊t/code {
(deref (future (eval-sci/eval-forms '[(+ 1 1)(+ 1 2)])))
}

We can evaluate code in ClojureScript without having to go self hosted.

The fact that it allows us to reify execution environments (and fork them
cheaply) opens a lot of possibilities up. Evaluations can occur on any number
of threads while being in their own sandboxed environments forked from a
common one.

Also I believe that using Sci carrefully, allows us not to take too big a
performance hit. Only code declared inside documents is going to be
interpreted by Sci. Functions that a document uses and that come from
the environment (the one created with sci.core/init) are Clojure functions
and I believe run directly as Clojure code.
